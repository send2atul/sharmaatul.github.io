<div class="indented"> <h2>Final Project in D3 using ElectionDonorDataset: </h2>
<h2>Dataset Used - Same which I used for Tableau mid term project. https://www.dropbox.com/s/l29oppon2veaq4n/Election_Donor_Data.csv?dl=0</h2> 
<p>I used python, jypter notebook to do data wrangling.</p> 
<h2>Overview of the dataset:</h2>
<p>It is a csv file which hold records of donoations made to candidates in 2012 Presidency elections In total I have three charts.</p>
<ul> <li>Summary of Donations made to Democrats/Republicans</li> 
<li>Drilling down to donations made to each candidate</li> 
<li>Going further granular, as I picked top 7 donors by occupation and showed who donated how much to which Candidate	</li>
 </ul> 
  
 <h2 style="color:red"> Please Note: I have used Hyperlinks in each bar chart tooltip. Click it to navigate to the next scene.</h2>
 
 <h2>Rubric Related:</h2>
 <ul><li>My visualization is a hybrid of martini glass/slideshow. I am starting with summary and then expanding/providing details on more grandular lever - From Party to Candidate. In the final chart, 
		I let the reader pick a candidate from the dropdown, So that gives him interaction capabilities.</li>
	<li>Parameters: I have used a Pie chart and a rectangle in the final chart, where in the drop down, if reader picks a candidate, pie chart and bar adjusts accordingly</li>
	<li>Trigger : Related to the parameter listed above. Once a candidate is picked, pie chart adjusts accordingly. Also, in the summary chart, have added mouse event wth tooltip, 
		for reader to click the party and it will take to the details chart. Even the hyperlinks in tooltip are part of trigger mechanism.</li>
	<li>Annotaions:  In my summary chart, my y -axis transitions from donor count to amount. It reflects sum/count as the label dynamically. Also,
		I have used static annotaions to showcase how though donors were more for Obama, total donation amount was larger for Republicans. This you can realize when the Y-axis toggle between sum/count 

 </ul
